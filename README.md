# Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores

## Project Description and Task
Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing test performance from NYC's public schools.

I the schools with top math results, look at how performance varies by borough, and find the top ten performing schools across the city!
