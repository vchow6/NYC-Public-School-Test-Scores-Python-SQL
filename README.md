# Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores

## Project Description and Task
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.

We will take a look at data on SATs across public schools in New York City in this *[notebook](https://github.com/vchow6/Project-Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores/edit/main/README.md#:~:text=t-,NYC_test_scores,-.ipynb)*. Our database contains a single table:
